Cyber Deck Raspberry Pi 4B build

THANKS! This is simply how I got it to work.
RECOMMENDED> Do not use 64bit OS
KALI> Yes, I got it to work with Kali arm64.  
PARROT> No, I could not get Parrot OS Security or Home to work.
KALI> Yes, Kali Linux...but could not get Desktop GUI.
KALI> Issue with no Desktop GUI.  Seems impossible to find a small keyboard that utilizes a wired connection.  This means you're using bluetooth.  Which means you're going to run cmdline to run bluetooth.
KALI> I did attempt this method of controlling the bluetooth through the commandline.  However, this step comes after setting up the WAVESHARE screen and now with the super small screen, scanning bluetooth signal and having to enter in MAC for devices this becomes a taxing process and I simply didn't get it to work well.  You are more than welcome to attempt it.

UPDATED 7.6.2024 - Will follow up with remaining notes.
